            <h3>Making the dough</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the sifted <span>flour</span> in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the <span>yeast</span>, finely crumbed.</li>
                <li><span>Mix</span> using a wooden spoon.</li>
                <li>Add <span>water</span> gradually, while you continue stirring until the flour absorbs it completely.</li>
                <li>Add <span>salt</span> and extra virgin <span>oil</span></li>
                <li>Keep stirring.</ol>
            </ol>
            <p>To obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough, now we can also knead by hand for a couple of minutes.</p>
            <p>Then we put the dough back into the bowl and cover it with a sheet of transparent film.</p>
            <p>The dough must rise for at least 30 min at room temperature and in a place sheltered from currents.</p>
            <p>The leaving must take place a temperature of about 25 degrees.</p>
            <h3>Homemade Pizza baking time and temperature</h3>
            <p>After leaving, we can roll out the <span>Pizza</span> in the baking pan. Before that, you should grease the baking pan with a little olive oil.</p>
            <p>It is always better to roll out the <span>Pizza</span> by hand and not with a rolling pin. The result will be softer!</p>
            <p>Depending on the size of your baking tray, you can divide the dough into several baking trays.</p>
            <p>Add the tomato sauce (seasoned with salt, oil and oregano to taste) and put in the oven at 200/220 degrees celsius (around 450 Farenheit) for 10/15 minutes.</p>
            <p>Remove from the oven and add the diced mozzarella.</p>
            <p>Bake for another 10/15 minutes (until the mozzarella is well melted but not burned.</p>
            <p>At this stage, you can also add other ingredients at your convenience.</p>
            <p>Now you can take it out of the oven and enjoy.</p>
