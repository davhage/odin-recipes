    <h2>Ingredients for the pizza</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="ingredients"><strong>Mozzarella cheese</strong>: 350 g</li>
        <li class="ingredients"><strong>Tomato sauce</strong>: 450 g</li>
        <li class="ingredients"><strong>Oil</strong>: Extra virgin olive oil as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Making the dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="steps">Put the sifted <strong>flour</strong> in a bowl.</li>
        <li class="steps">Add the <strong>yeast</strong>, finely crumbed.</li>
        <li class="steps"><strong>Mix</strong> using a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li class="steps">Add <strong>water</strong> gradually, while you continue stirring until the flour absorbs it completely.</li>
        <li class="steps">Add <strong>salt</strong> and extra virgin <strong>oil</strong></li>
        <li class="steps">Keep stirring.</ol>
    </ol>
    <p>To obtain a smooth and homogeneous dough, now we can also knead by hand for a couple of minutes.</p>
    <p>Then we put the dough back into the bowl and cover it with a sheet of transparent film.</p>
    <p>The dough must rise for at least 30 min at room temperature and in a place sheltered from currents.</p>
    <p>The leaving must take place a temperature of about 25 degrees.</p>
    <h3>Homemade Pizza baking time and temperature</h3>
    <p>After leaving, we can roll out the <strong>Pizza</strong> in the baking pan. Before that, you should grease the baking pan with a little olive oil.</p>
    <p>It is always better to roll out the <strong>Pizza</strong> by hand and not with a rolling pin. The result will be softer!</p>
    <p>Depending on the size of your baking tray, you can divide the dough into several baking trays.</p>
    <p>Add the tomato sauce (seasoned with salt, oil and oregano to taste) and put in the oven at 200/220 degrees celsius (around 450 Farenheit) for 10/15 minutes.</p>
    <p>Remove from the oven and add the diced mozzarella.</p>
    <p>Bake for another 10/15 minutes (until the mozzarella is well melted but not burned.</p>
    <p>At this stage, you can also add other ingredients at your convenience.</p>
    <p>Now you can take it out of the oven and enjoy.</p>
